    "                My editor tells me that it makes a MASSIVE difference when students rate this course on Udemy - it's one of the main ways that Udemy decides whether to show it to others. If you're able to take a minute to rate this, I'd be so very grateful! And regardless - always please reach out to me at ed@edwarddonner.com if I can help at any point.\n",
